# ants-farm
the goal of this project is to find the most efficient way to get N ants from source to sink in an undirected graph.

## usage
after runing `make` an executable `ants` will compile.
then run `./ants < map`. check `farms` folder for some generated maps
and use `-v` flag for visualisation
Ps: Only tested in OS X
